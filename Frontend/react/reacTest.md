### MedLab Media Group – Frontend Test

Here (In the following links) you have a list of peoplefrom a town called Brastlewark, you have to make a list of them and also you have to show details of every single person of the town in a human readable way. You have to upload you code to an accessible repo.

Repo: https://github.com/rrafols/mobile_testJson Data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrafols/mobile_test/master/data.json

Please  write  an  application  using  React.  Use  the  latest  React  version  possible.  The  use  of packages like: Redux, react-router, etc. to help our team browse and be able to see the details of those people.

Specifications:

 - Retrieve data from the URL provided.
 - Use of ES6.
 - Use of any package bundler (Such as: Webpack, parcel).
 - Show  this  data  in  the  most  user-friendly  way  you  could  think.  Our  users  are  really impatient, so the app must be really simple and easy to use. At least would be good to quickly browse (and even filter) all the individuals and be able to see the details of each one.
 - Document all decisions about the architecture of the application (Libraries, code, state management, bundler, etc).
 - Responsive design (The user MUST be able to use the application in both his laptop and smartphone).
 - Test the application: add the most important test you think it is needed (You are free to use whatever libraries or testing tools you want butremember to tell us why you pick those).

This is nice to have, but it’s not required (If you don’t have the time, you could explain how you would do it if you have it):

 - README for the repo of the application.
 - Good use of the git branching system.
 - Nice commit messaging (To see the evolution of the app).
 - Linters (Such as ESLint, StyleLint).
 - Pre-commit hooks (Or pre-push).
 - UI must not blocked by network connections or long operations.
 - Images coming from network cached to improve performance
 - Error handling.
 - Avoid using third party libraries for basic functionality (we want to see you know the basics!).
 - Use third party libraries for extended functionality.
 - Snappiness & responsiveness.
